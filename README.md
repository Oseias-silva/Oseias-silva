- 👋 Hi, I’m @Oseias-silva
- 👀 About two weeks ago I decided to become a programmer 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS and I have also accomplished all the freeCodeCamp tutorials on HTML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically everything I can apply this very little, introductory knoledge I've acquired for the past two weeks
- 📫 To be sincere I don't know if I have the minimun that's required for a person like me (a complete beginner) to help others, but still I'm leaving here my e-mail contact (olimasilva.19@gmail.com) in good faith.
